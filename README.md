Hi! I'm Hans, and this is my first actual coding project.

This was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and was made as a simple web game for my high school's computer science club way back in 2018 in collaboration with other members. 

The game is pretty simple, "catch" as many laser pointers as you can with your cat paw to rack up your score as high as possible.

I hope you enjoy!
